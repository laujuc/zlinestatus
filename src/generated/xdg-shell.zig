/// 
/// Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order

/// xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
/// not based on xdg_surface.

/// for the xdg_surface state to take effect.
/// 
/// Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
/// committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
/// manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
/// also be treated as errors.
/// 
/// After creating a role-specific object and setting it up (e.g. by sending
/// the title, app ID, size constraints, parent, etc), the client must
/// perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor
/// will reply with initial wl_surface state such as
/// wl_surface.preferred_buffer_scale followed by an xdg_surface.configure
/// event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a
/// buffer to map the surface.
/// 
/// Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
/// possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
/// a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.
/// 
/// For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
/// conditions must be met:
/// (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
/// (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the

/// fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
/// id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive
/// resize and move.
/// 
/// A xdg_toplevel by default is responsible for providing the full intended

/// by the compositor until it is explicitly mapped again.

/// attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for
/// an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel returns to
/// the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client
/// can re-map the toplevel by performing a commit without any buffer
/// attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual (see
